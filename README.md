### Hello there! 👋

- 👨‍💻 iOS developer since 2014, now working at theScore
- 🏡 Born in the UK, but now living in Atlantic Canada
- 📲 I’m currently working on my own indie apps:
  - [Söka](https://trysoka.app), a powerful bucket list app that uses AI to help you discover new goals
  - [Classifier](https://getclassifier.app), a simple yet powerful app for collectors of just about anything
  - [Ceramispace](https://ceramispace.app), an all-in-one app for ceramicists
- ✍️ I write [a newsletter](https://roddymunro.substack.com) about indie app development
- 📫 Reach me via [Mastodon](https://iosdev.space/@podomunro) to ask me about Swift or iOS development in general
